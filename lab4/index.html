<h1>Lab 4!</h1>
<h2>Challenge:</h2>
	<p>The challenge of this lab is to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
<h2>Problems:</h2>
	<p>I encountered quite a few problems in this lab. First off i was unable to find a lab partner so i have to submit this alone. Second i have zero prior knowledge or experience with computer programming so i have no ide the proper way to write high-level tasks that would be used in a computer program. I also found the whole java script part confusing to code and the instructions didnt explain what we were doing.</p>
	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<div class="task1">
	<h3> Task 1:</h3>
		</div>
	<ol>
		1) Create a list of high-level tasks.
		2) If necessary, break complicated tasks down into sub-steps.
		3)Put this in outline form.
	</ol>
	<h4>How to start a dirtbike:</h4>
	<ol>
		1) Put the key in the ignition.

		9) Slowly release the clutch while accelerating.
	</ol>
		<div class="task2">
	<h3>Task 2:</h3>
		</div>
	<h4>Pseudocode game of dots and boxes</h4>
	<ol>
		1) Create a 10x10 square of boxes.
		2) Establish player colors
		3) Accept user input each turn
		4) Place associated color line between dots
		5) Make computer search for possible plays to create boxes
		6) Play turn to maximize points earned
		7) Count players points/boxes
	</ol>
		<div class="task3">
	<h3>Task 3:</h3>
		</div>
	<pre><code>
		//create a 10x10 square of boxes.
