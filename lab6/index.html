			<h1>Lab 6</h2>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>							The Challenge of this lab was to experiment with basic JavaScript arrays and objects. A challenge I faced in this lab is maintaining and remembering the rules that apply to arrays and objects. Especially the proper format in Javascript and keeping the code clean.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>							The main problem that I encountered during this lab was understanding, and trying to figure out, the proper way and format for arrays and objects in Javascript. Istill struggle with understanding when to use, and the difference between, quotes and parenthesis, squigly and regular brackets, colons and semi-colons, etc.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>								Here are the results of my lab. it took me a while to get my arrays to neatly output my arrays and objects but its working great now.</p>
