	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>							The Challenge of this lab was to: Experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>							Firstly I can not figure out how to get Rid of the extra space in my results tab. The main problem i encountered in this lab was i could not figure out why my outputs werent showing up. Finally after messing around with the javascript file for about a day I realized it was because in my HTML file i had my JS file listed as lab9.js but my file was names lab.js. Real facepalm moment🤦🏼‍♂️ </p>
