		<h1>Lab 5!?</h2>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>							The Challenge of this lab was to experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables. A challenge I faced was trying to understand how boolean varibles work, especially the proper format in Javascript.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>							The main problem that I encountered during this lab was understanding, and trying to figure out, the proper way and format to correctly create and output variables from Javascript.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>								Here are the results of my lab. I had quite a lot of difficulty getting the proper outputs from my Javascript variables but its working great now.</p>
