	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>							The main problem I encountered in this lab was I could not ficure out why my result section button would load. Through the console I was able to determine it was between the button being clicked and being associated with the new class. Eventually I realized it was because I didnt put a hashtag before my ID name on the JS file for the results section.</p>
