					<h1>Lab 7</h2>
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>							The Challenge of this lab was to experiment with basic functions that take user imput.</p>
					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>							Here are the problems i have faced: The main problem that i faced during this lab that I encountered was that once I had finished all the work, once again i could not figure out why my script was not outputing on to my page. I finally realized the problem was that during on the the output in my JS file i had not uppercased the term like "sortUserName", instead i had it like "sortusername". Glad to have found the problem, which i did by inspecting element on my console.</p>
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>							Here are the results of my lab: Not the neatest but it does the trick alright!</p>
